## Pong Game ##
__This is a replica of the well-known "Pong", a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis.__   
The players control in-game paddles by moving them vertically across the left and right side of the screen.   
Here, the right side controls the paddle using the "up"-"down" key combination and the left side with "w" for up and "s" for down.    
_Once again, turtle module is at the heart of the project. The paddles, the ball and also, the scores are objects of classes inherited from the Turtle parent class._
